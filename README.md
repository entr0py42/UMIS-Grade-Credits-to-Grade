So the semester is over and grades are uploaded but you cannot see them because they aren't announced yet. You can see them on Slots page but it only shows Grade x Credits, and you are too lazy to divide them together for each lecture.

Luckily, you can copy the code from console.js, go to Slots page, filter by currently taken lectures, press F12, go to Console tab and then paste & run.
